            <h1>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</h1>
            <p>
                I also listened to this book as an audiobook. This book give me some profound understanding of how I should live my life. <br>
                <br>
                One being a really cool understanding. Which is that fault and responsiblity are different. When you learn to seperate the two, you will be more 
                content with your position. An example it gave was if you were to find a baby on your doorstep, that is not your fault that the baby is there, but it
                is your responsiblity to make sure the baby is properly taken care of. <br>
                <br>
                This book was also the one that introduced me to "When Breathe Becomes Air". Although the title can seem a bit edgy, this book not only taught me how to view life
                but also how to live life. When you focus on the values you wish to uphold, then everyday is a challenge of how you will abide by your values.<br>
                <br>
                This book also made me question the way I lived. I was living life with the goal of something. To achieve something. But the way this book showed me how to view life
                has got me rethinking my values. It would be similar to the way I approach a new years resolution. Instead of saying this year I want to do something. I instead 
                focus on the theme of this year. And for the past year my theme has been "being umcomfortable". Which means if I know something I do will make me umcomfortable such as 
                talking to a stranger, then I'd do that.<br>
                <br>
                Overall I'd say this book has given me some good questions to ask. And I will reread this book in the future to see if the way I choose to live my life 
                is similar to the way the book recommended.
