            <h1>When Breathe Becomes Air</h1>
            <p>
                I heard of this book from "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" as it was mentioned when talking about the value of life and importance of life. 
                I came to this book hoping to gain a new profound meaning of what means. I expected to be given the answer by a neurosurgen on the brink of death. Thinking
                he figured it out. How wrong I was. <br>
                <br>
                This book wasn't about telling the reader a lesson. I felt this book was written to remind people the duality of life and death. Written by someone who was both in control of life
                while simultaneously losing his own. <br>
                <br>
                The vivid descriptions he described of his training and the transition from student to doctor was so blunt it felt like he was describing the loss of his innocense. To start viewing life 
                as a balance. His unique situation also allowed him to understand more about what makes up the sense of self. <br>
                <br> 
                This book was really an emotional rollarcoaster. Life truly has it's moments. Never have I been reminded more of the duality of life. On one hand, life is so resilient. To continue to persevere
                is the beauty of life. <br>
                <br>
                After reading this book I have a much more developed respect for doctors especially surgens.
