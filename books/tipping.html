            <h1>The Tipping Point</h1>
            <p>
                This is an interesting book as I stumbbled upon it when I helped my mentor move out of his old house as he was about to remodel everything. 
                One of the books he had which he gave to me was this book. It was old and dusty but in good condition so I read it. <br>
                <br>
                reading this book has helped me understand more about how humans as a group operate. Manytimes it is the small changes that make the big differnece
                hence the "tipping point". <br>
                <br>
                It is interesting to think about the existence of the tipping point beyond the examples in the book, although also noteworthy. For instance, in 
                a classroom, why is it that sometimes the class can stay quiet for minutes when the professor asks a question, but once that one person raises their hand
                then everyone starts participating? <br>
                <br>
                I think this book is a very good introduction to the concept of the "tipping point" however I am very interested in the psychological aspect of why it exists. 
                Is it something humans are concious of or is it something that is ingrained in our psyche? <br>
                <br>
                I continue to notice more "tipping points" throughout my life.
