            <p>
                I listened to the audiobook version of this book my sophmore year of college. Manytimes at night when I'm bored but couldn't sleep, I would lie on my
                bed and listen to audiobooks. This was one of them. <br>
                <br>
                I don't think just one experience or choice no matter how big or small make up the person. From what I've heard from this book, I see a lot of Elon's father's personality
                in my own father. <br>
                <br>
                Instead of focusing on the person, I'd much rather focus on the attitude. What I've come to realize from this book is that Elon is a doer. It might've been how the book
                was written with Walter Isaacson's writing being extremely succinct, however it felt to me that each of Elon's decisions were simply done. <br>
                <br>
                When he wanted to move to America, he just did. There was no internal monologue about the pros and cons. Or when he started a startup with his brother there was no
                what will we do next. There was only, go. <br>
                <br>
                It truly shocked me how direct Elon can be both in his actions and his words, and has made me consider how I should act personally. I don't necessarily think you must
                act like Elon to achieve what he did as success requires a lot of luck and action. However, I think it is worth considering the pros and cons of the life Elon either chooses
                or has to live. That being the extreme stress he puts himself under everyday. To throw so much time with family to focus on a righteous goal of bettering humanity. <br>
                <br>
                I'm not sure what the answer is, but it has allowed me to think more about how I live my life and what kind of life I want to live for myself.
