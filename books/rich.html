            <p>This was the first ever finance book I ever read. I remember vividly the day I started learning the value of money. 
                Growing up, I've always viewed money as a currency but it never went beyond the superficial understanding that money was a means to exchange 
                goods or services. I never valued the work and effort in making money nor the growth of personal wealth. As a child I was just give money 
                to spend if my parents let me. Or told not to buy something if it wasn't rational. <br>
                <br>
                However, I reached a point in high school where it hit me that money was important. And to truly appreciate it, you'd have to understand how to earn it.
                I went online and searched up the most popular finance books and this was one of the most popular books out there. <br>
                <br>
                I have reread this book twice now. Once when I was in highschool and once again my freshmen year of college.
                This book gave me a better understanding of how you should view finance and allowed me to draw parallels between my real experience 
                with my mentor and my biological father. However there was a lot of nuance and just because the book specifically referred to rich dad as well, 
                rich dad, I don't think the values of poor dad should be ignored. <br>
                <br>
                This book changed my perspective on the differnece between a liability and an asset. And it was the door that opened up my understanding of 
                corporations and other business concepts.<br>
                <br>
                If I have the chance, I would definitely reread this book a third time.
