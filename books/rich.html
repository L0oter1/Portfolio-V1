                <p>This was the first ever finance book I ever read maybe even the first book I ever read seriously myself without being told to by my teacher haha. I remember vividly the day I started learning the value of money. 
                    Growing up, I've always viewed money as a currency but it never went beyond the superficial understanding that money was a means to exchange 
                    goods or services. I never valued the hard work and effort in making money nor the growth of personal wealth. As a child I was just given money 
                    to spend if my parents let me for a field trip or if I wanted candy. Or told not to buy something if it wasn't good for me or I shouldn't have it. And I always listened <br>
                    <br>
                    However, I reached a point in middle school where it hit me that money was something you worked for. And that there wasn't an unlimited supply. Yes, the rectangle of infinite money was in fact not infinite.
                    And to truly appreciate it, you'd have to understand how to earn it. I was extremely curious of learning more about proper finances and money management and so
                    I went online and searched up the most popular finance books and this was one of the most popular books out there. A classic. <br>
                    <br>
                    I have reread this book twice now. Once when I was in middle school and once again my freshmen year of college. I might have to read it a third time.
                    This book gave me a better understanding of how you should view finances and allowed me to draw parallels between my real experience 
                    with my mentor and my biological father. However there was a lot of nuance and just because the book specifically referred to rich dad as well, 
                    rich dad, I don't the values of poor dad should be ignored. <br>
                    <br>
                    This book changed my perspective on the difference between a liability and an asset. And it was the door that opened up my understanding of 
                    corporations and other business concepts which later evolved into me reading books about how to protect your assets from lawsuits and proper business entities to protect yourself from liability.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the story there was one part where rich dad told the narrator that he is successful because he had people who was smarter than him working for him. You didn't have to be the smartest in the room, simply the person who was in charge. This made me 
                    think more about how you'd begin to be the one that smarter people work for. And reminded me of the chinese lesson that said you live till you're old, you learn till you're old. You never stop learning in life. And the fact that you view smarter people working
                    for you as an opportunity to learn from them shows how there is always something you can learn from someone else. <br>
                    <br>
                    If you wanted a simple introduction to personal finaces and wanted a good first book to start, I would definitely recommend this book to you.
